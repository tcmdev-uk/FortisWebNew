      <p><strong>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
      <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.</em></p>

This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it.

      <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third parties that we may link to or who advertise on our Services, but are not affiliated with, our Services.</em></p>
      <p>The Services&nbsp;may link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile applications and/or contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, services, or applications. Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications. The inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service, or application does not imply an endorsement by us. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the Services. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.</p>
      <p><strong>6. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</strong></p>
      <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</em></p>
      <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.</p>
      <p>We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.</p>
      <p>Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.</p>
      <p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
      <p>We may share your information with Google Analytics to track and analyse the use of the Services. To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across the Services, visit <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>. For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy &amp; Terms page</a>.</p>

      <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).</p>
      <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or&nbsp;anonymise&nbsp;such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
      <p><strong>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></p>
      <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.</em></p>
      <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and&nbsp;organisational&nbsp;security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other&nbsp;unauthorised&nbsp;third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
      <p><strong>9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</strong></p>
