        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold  "> Ok we know it sounds biased... But lets get real!</h2>
        <p class="mt-1 text-[1.1rem] font-light">As a website development business, it's easy for us to say that you need a website—it’s a bit biased, don't you think? However, we wouldn't have built our entire business around websites if we didn't think they were worth it. Websites can do what you want them to do, whether that be an education platform, bringing people together by creating communities, scaling your dream, or much more importantly catapulting your business! We love websites and love developing them because they can be shaped into something that will truly change your life.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-5"> It's never been so important </h2>
        <p class="mt-1 text-[1.1rem] font-light">As a tradesman in this day and age, it's never been more important to have a website of your own. There is so much competition out there at the moment. Trust us, we have done a fair bit of research on your industry and feel like we can offer a competitive edge when it comes to building an online platform. A lot of businesses in many industries, not just the trade industry, miss the mark when it comes to websites. Whether it’s forgetting about the website as a whole or only having a one-page WordPress website that does nothing for your business (that’s not us slating WordPress—we have huge respect for the platform), we are highlighting an issue that all industries face. However, one of the most common industries we found that don’t harness the power of websites is businesses within the trade industry.</p>
        <img class="w-full h-auto mt-5 rounded-lg" src="../../assets/Photos/General/analyse.jpg" alt="">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-5"> Ditch your old relationship with websites</h2>
        <p class="mt-1 text-[1.1rem] font-light">We get it—you’d rather be on the tools and working from the phone. It makes sense, and if that works for you, then that’s absolutely fine. However, we are not here to change that. We understand, with our years of experience in the industry, that websites can be somewhat complicated. There is so much that goes into them that you just don’t have time to focus on when you have a business to run. It ultimately slows you down, and a quick hour dedicated to your site every day just won’t cut it in regards to value for time. That’s where we come in. We offer round-the-clock support, updates, analytics, and bug finding. We are somewhat perfectionists when it comes to websites, so you’re with the right crowd.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 "> Mission: <span class="text-orange-500"> Scale your business </span> </h2>
        <p class="mt-2 text-[1.1rem] font-light">Our websites come with so much more than just a brochure website that stays a brochure website. We want to create a brand for you that you're proud of sharing. We want every visitor to your site to have the highest chance of becoming a customer. We have well-thought-out systems in place to get your site up and running as fast and as high quality as possible. We have had a lot of experience in the industry over the last couple of years but have just recently started focusing on the trade industry as we believe that a lot more can be given to tradespeople around the UK. We don’t just build sites; we grow businesses. We create websites solely based on the customer’s journey on your site to maximize leads and sales.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 "> We are on your team and <span class="text-orange-500"> we are very competitive </span> </h2>
        <p class="mt-2 text-[1.1rem] font-light">We design and develop beautiful sites that will give you the competitive edge in your chosen industry, whether you're an electrician, plumber, roofer, landscaper, builder, carpenter, etc.—the list goes on. We can help. There’s so much potential for your business to grow in your area. Our market research found that 70% of trade businesses don’t own sites! Then the ones who do own sites are the ones killing it in their industry. If you ask us, that’s a massive space to thrive. So take the leap and work with us. We want to make every person we work with the best in their city. We are very aggressive in our tactics and want more inspired people like yourself to work with us every day. Let’s get working together. I have left a form down below—we would love to hear from you and your business. Join Team Fortis!</p>
